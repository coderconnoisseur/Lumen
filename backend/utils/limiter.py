"""Shared Flask-Limiter instance (initialized in app.py).

Rate-limit keys are derived per authenticated user when a JWT is present,
falling back to the remote address for pre-auth requests. This means:

- Two devices signed in as the same user share one bucket (correct — they
  are one identity).
- Users behind a shared IP (NAT, corporate proxy) get independent buckets
  once signed in, so one heavy user cannot exhaust another's quota.
- Anonymous callers still get IP-based limits — enough to blunt drive-by
  probing of the auth endpoints themselves.

The `sub` claim we read here is NOT signature-verified: Flask-Limiter only
uses it as a bucket key, not for access control (`@require_auth` still
enforces full verification before any handler runs). If an attacker crafts
a JWT with a fake `sub` they simply land in their own bucket — they cannot
exhaust a legitimate user's quota.

Default limit (`60/minute` for every unattributed route) is enough headroom
for a normal browsing session while capping obviously abusive traffic.
Individual routes tighten this via `@limiter.limit(...)`.
